# ESP8266-ESP12-MinBreakout
Minimal breakout board for the ESP8266 model ESP12 board

A breakout board for the ESP8266 model ESP12 board, but with a twist. The down-facing header pins are installed with very little protrusion on the top, then some insulation is added (electrical tape), then the ESP12 is SMT soldered on top. This makes this breakout far smaller than the existing ones, and much more breadboard friendly.

Comes in through-hole and SMT flavors. The through-hole flavor rev1 has been successfully fabbed and populated and works perfectly.
